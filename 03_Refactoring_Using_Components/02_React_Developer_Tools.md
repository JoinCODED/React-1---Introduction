1. But can we track our components in the browser? Yes we can, Google Chrome has an extension called [React Developer Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en). Install it.

2. To access those tools, right click on your web browser and click on `Inspect`. You'll see 2 tabs `Components` and `Profile` at the end of the tabs list with a purple React icon.

3. Click on `Components`, this is where you will see your components. As you can see, we have two components atm `App` and `CookieList`, and `App` is the parent component of `CookieList`.
